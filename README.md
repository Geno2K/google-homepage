As part of the Odin Project, I created this replica of the Google homepage to test my ability to
implement some basic HTML and CSS by memory or with minimal reference.

The process helped familiarize me with the workflow of writing code for a website, testing and 
troubleshooting as necessary along the way.

The end result is far from perfect, but feels appropriate for the scope of the project and 
fitting for my skill level at this time.
